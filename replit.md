# ZTM - Data Structures and Algorithms (Python)

Personal implementations and practice exercises from the 'Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms' course using Python.

## Project Structure

- `main.py` - Entry point script
- Python scripts for data structures and algorithm exercises

## Environment

- **Language**: Python 3.11
- **Workflow**: Console (runs `python3 main.py`)

## Running

The project uses a console workflow to run `python3 main.py`. Add your data structures and algorithm Python files to the project and run them via the workflow or directly with `python3 <filename>.py`.
